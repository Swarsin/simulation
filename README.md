# Simulation
This program lets the user customise the specifications of a nuclear reactor (e.g. coolant, control rod, fuel type) and calculates yearly and total energy output with an input of fuel amount, it also generates a scatter plot and regression line using this data. If the user doesn't know much about nuclear reactors, there is a section where they can learn about the main ideas behind nuclear reactors, and the data displayed is scraped from Wikipedia using their API.
